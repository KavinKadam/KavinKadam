# Nice to meet you, I'm Kavin! #

Iâ€™m interested in Data Analytics and Quantitative Finance. I currently major in biology and minor in commerce at UBC and am self-teaching myself Python, R, SQL, Git and the MEAN stack.
You can reach me at kavinkadam@alumni.ubc.ca or on my social media:

_Failures are great because they allow me to learn - ask me about my academic journey!_

#### _My Experience & Outlook_ ####

I run day-to-day operations at [Clarify Student Resources](clarifysr.com), a social enterprise where we provide free and premium services to post-secondary students.
I also handle financse at [UBC Sailbot](https://www.ubcsailbot.org/), where I maintain sponsor relations, accounting and funding as the Finance Lead.
Using these experiences as leverage, I hope to expand my understanding of finance, entrepreneurship and data analytics, eventually hoping to land a quant-based role in
investment banking.

I'm a people-person and with my experience comes the understanding that humans are multidimensional. So if you're a recruiter, colleague or anyone really, come drop me a message.
I'd love to see how I can help, even if I don't always look the part!
