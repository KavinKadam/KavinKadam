"If the workplace had a no-clothes policy, you'd hit the gym more often". <br />
With this same line of thought, I make most of my repositories public, even though they may not contain the best code.

I'm a people-person and with my experience comes the understanding that humans are multidimensional. So if you're a recruiter, colleague or anyone really, come drop me a message.
I'd love to see how I can help, even if I don't always look the part!
